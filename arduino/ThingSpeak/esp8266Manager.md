1. Select File, then Preferences
2. In the Additional Boards Manager URLs text box, enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json and hit OK
3. Select Tools, mouse over your currently selected board, and choose Boards Manager from the popup menu
4. In the Boards Manager window that appears, enter ESP in the Filter your search… box, click on the esp8266 by ESP8266 Community entry that appears, and then select Install
5. Wait for a while, while the Board Definitions and Tools are downloaded – and note, you can use this same download to support a whole heap of other boards, including the WeMos D1 mini, the Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266, and the NodeMCU ESP-12E dev board that I’m so, so fond of.
6. Once complete, select Tools again, and choose the WeMos D1 from the Boards dropdown.
